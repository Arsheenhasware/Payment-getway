                        Smile Foundation, an Indian social development organization, is directly benefitting over 15 lakh children and their families every year.<br> We have more than 400 live welfare projects on education, healthcare, livelihood, and womenâ€™s empowerment  <br>       
        The groundwork for a better life lies in education.<br> It is the most powerful catalyst for social transformation.<br> However, a child cannot be educated in isolation.<br> Only an empowered family, especially the mother, would be willing to educate their child.<br> Thus, rather than focusing on only one stage of a person's life, we believe in the lifecycle approach.<br></p>
